This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install:

```bash
npm i
# or
yarn
```

Second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Lastly,

Register / Sign in to access the dashboard.

You will need to register for an account and sign in to access any of the pages. If you can access any pages without signing in, we need to fix that!

This web app uses Firebase auth, so passwords are not stored in Firestore. By default, no data is stored in Firestore (at least not data we can access), and I have set up a `users` collection to store user data.

## Issues

I'm going to try managing all To-Do's in Github issues. If you want to work on an issue, create a branch and assign yourself to the issue!
